## Baselines

This directory contains the code for the simple baselines that are found through direct computation: majority vote, mean, and median, and random. It also has some scripts for worker-level analysis: calculating the mean worker mse and mean worker accuracy. `worker_scores.ipynb` creates visualizations of worker quality.

The `results` directory contains the output obtained for the HCOMP submission.

**NOTE:** the distance-based annotationmodeling repo also implements random user. Get-Another-Label (DawidSkene) implements a version of MV.
